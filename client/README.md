# IP Heatmap Frontend
The IP Heatmap backend consumes a REST API providing locational information for
IP addresses. At present, the platform only displays IPv4 addresses, though it is
capable of supporting IPv6.

This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) with
[React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) and was bootstrapped
using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
